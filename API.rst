Key Server API
==============

The server URLs semantics is mostly REST semantics ::

  https://<server>/<api path>/<version>/<further instructions>

The rest of this document only presents the <further instructions> part
and makes the assumption that the API is served behind an ssl connection
that protects the requests header, body and query options during transport,
as well as the responses content.

The proposed service is implemented as an FxA content provider, so it accepts
Bearer Tokens with the **keys:** scope as a form of authentication.


GET /<email>/apps/<appid>/key
#############################

- **scope**: keys
- **authentication**: FxA Oauth token
- **authorization**: any FxA user with a valid OAuth token and
  with an existing key pair for this app.

Returns the keys of a given user for a given app.
The returned value is a json mapping containing:

- **pubKey**: the public key
- **encPrivKey**: the encrypted private key, if the authenticated user matches the email
